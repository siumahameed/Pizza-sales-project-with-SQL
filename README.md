I am Sium Ahameed, currently pursuing my education in 
Statistics with a focused ambition to become a data scientist. 
My journey in data science is guided by a structured roadmap 
that I meticulously follow to ensure I acquire the essential skills and knowledge needed to excel in this dynamic field.I am practicing  SQL through some projects. 

Working on this project was really cool! We dug into pizza 
hut’s sales using SQL, cleaned it up and found some neat insights. 
We learned a lot and can’t wait to use our newfound skills in 
future projects. Thanks to everyone involved for a great experience!
If you have any questions or would like to discuss this project further, feel free to reach out to me.
